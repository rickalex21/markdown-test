This is a dummy repo used for testing. Have you ever wanted to test a recursive function
in a [node module](https://www.npmjs.com/) or test a regex in [ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags)?
Perhaps you want to try a new static site generator. Whatever the case may be this
repo has real content to help with testing. There is also a markdown/html test page (html.md).
